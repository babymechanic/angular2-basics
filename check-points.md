## Check points
### Step 1
  - Clean up code
    - rename variables to something descriptive 
    - making injected values readonly
    - get rid of comments
    - get rid of commented out code 
    - encapsulation 
    - feature rich objects
  - Issues
    - test only tests at a much higher level will be difficult as more objects are introduced
### Step 2  
  - How to add more tests
    - Add a spec file for each file we want to test
    - add tests for each of the methods that the class exposes
  - Issues
    - It looks like we are retesting the code which is already tested
    - getting difficult to write a test for some thing which depends on another class
